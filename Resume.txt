ACADEMIC PROJECTS
Hardware Design Labs	Jan-March 2020
● Built multiple digital circuit schematics of increasing complexity, beginning with simple logic functions
● Used Intel Quartus to apply the circuit schematics to a physical FPGA, which was used to test the circuit designs
● Created a microcontroller circuit schematic by combining simpler schematics from previous labs
Musical Instrument Design Group Project	Oct-Dec 2020
Project Description:  As a group, we designed and built musical instruments, recorded a song, and made a presentation.
Individual Contributions:
● Performed physics calculations for instrument designs and typed them up via LaTeX 
● Designed and built a drum
● Helped organized the design and implementation of the PowerPoint presentation
